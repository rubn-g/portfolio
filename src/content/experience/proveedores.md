As CTO at Proveedores, I spearheaded the entire project development from inception.
My responsibilities included managing AWS-hosted servers and databases while optimizing costs, collaborating with the CEO to plan and architect new features, and providing regular development status reports.
I leveraged technologies such as PHP, AWS, and MySQL to build a robust and scalable platform.
This role required a blend of technical expertise, strategic planning, and effective communication to drive the startup's technological growth and success.
